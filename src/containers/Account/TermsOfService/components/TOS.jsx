The sale of illegal or unsafe products can also lead to legal action, including civil and criminal penalties. We are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers and working with regulators, third party experts, vendors, and sellers to improve the ways we detect and prevent illegal and unsafe products from reaching our marketplace. CannExchange encourages you to report listings that violate CannExchange's policies or applicable law by&nbsp;<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/cu/contact-us">contacting us</a>.

<p><b>34.1</b> For non-invoiced orders, you authorize CannExchange Payments, Inc. to act as your agent for purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions, receiving and holding Sales Proceeds on your behalf, remitting Sales Proceeds to Your Bank Account, charging your Credit Card, and paying CannExchange and its Affiliates amounts you owe in accordance with this Agreement or other agreements you may have with CannExchange Affiliates. For invoiced orders, you authorize: (a) CannExchange to act as your agent for purposes of processing payments, refunds and adjustments for Your Transactions, and receiving and holding Sales Proceeds on your behalf; and (b) CannAvenue Ltd to act as your agent for purposes of remitting Sales Proceeds to Your Bank Account, charging your Credit Card, and paying CannExchange and its Affiliates amounts you owe in accordance with this Agreement or other agreements you may have with CannExchange Affiliates. CannAvenue Ltd and CannAvenue Group US LLC are&nbsp;<b>"CannExchange</b> <b>Payments Agent"</b>. The applicable CannExchange Payments Agents provide the services described in these Transaction Processing Service Terms and the related services. (collectively, the&nbsp;<b>"Transaction Processing Services"</b>).</p>
<p><b>34.2</b> When a buyer instructs us to pay you, you agree that the buyer authorizes and orders us to commit the buyer's payment (less any applicable fees or other amounts we may collect under this Agreement) to you. You agree that buyers satisfy their obligations to you for Your Transactions when we receive the Sales Proceeds. We will remit funds to you in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p><b>35. </b><b>Remittance</b></p>
<p>Subject to Section 15 of the General Terms of this Agreement, the applicable CannExchange Payments Agents will remit funds to you in accordance with Section S-5 of the Agreement and these Transaction Processing Service Terms. Each applicable CannExchange Payments Agent's obligation to remit funds collected or received by it or otherwise credited to your available balance in connection with Your Transactions is limited to funds in your available balance that have become available in accordance with this Agreement less amounts owed to CannExchange and any taxes that CannExchange automatically calculates, collects and remits to a tax authority according to applicable law, as specified in the Tax Policies, subject to chargeback or reversal or withheld for anticipated claims in accordance with this Agreement. Without limiting CannExchange's rights to collect any amounts you owe, the applicable CannExchange Payments Agent's receipt of Sales Proceeds or crediting of Sales Proceeds to your available balance discharges your obligation to pay applicable fees and other amounts under this Agreement to the extent the Sales Proceeds received or credited equal or exceed the fees and other amounts you owe and the Sales Proceeds are applied to the payment of those fees and amounts.</p>
<p><b>36. </b><b>Your Funds</b></p>
<p>Your Sales Proceeds will be held in an account with the applicable CannExchange Payments Agent (a&nbsp;<b>"Seller Account"</b>) and will represent an unsecured claim against that CannExchange Trade Payments Agent. Your Sales Proceeds are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, nor do you have any right or entitlement to collect Sales Proceeds directly from any customer. Prior to disbursing funds to you, a CannExchange Payments Agent may combine Sales Proceeds held with the funds of other users of the Services, invest them, or use them for other purposes permitted by applicable Laws. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any Sale Proceeds. To the extent required by applicable Laws, a CannExchange Payments Agent will not use any funds held on your behalf for its corporate purposes, will not voluntarily make such funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit its creditors to attach such funds.</p>
<p><b>37. </b><b>Verification</b></p>
<p>We may at any time require you to provide any financial, business or personal information we request to verify your identity. You authorize us to obtain from time to time consumer credit reports to establish or update your Seller Account or in the event of a dispute relating to this Agreement or the activity under your Seller Account. You agree to update all Seller Account information promptly upon any change. The&nbsp;CannExchange Payments Privacy Notice&nbsp;applies to transactions processed by CannExchange Payments, Inc.</p>

<p>3.4 We may disclose your inquiry data to one or more of those selected third-party suppliers of services via APIs identified on our website for the purpose of enabling them to connect your account with their Services, if any.
