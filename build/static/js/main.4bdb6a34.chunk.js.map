Dangerous goods (also called hazardous materials or hazmat) are substances or materials that may pose a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment while storing, handling or transporting because they contain flammable, pressurized, corrosive, or otherwise harmful substances. While the term \"dangerous good\" is often thought of as highly corrosive or toxic products, it actually also refers to consumer products used on a daily basis by millions of people (such as laptops, phones, household cleaners, or even cosmetics). It is extremely important for CannExchange to gather information about products regulated as dangerous goods or that contain possibly harmful chemicals to prevent any safety incidents that could occur while handling, storing, or transporting these items.</p>\n<p><b>17.10 Restricted Products</b>. Customers trust that they can always buy with confidence on CannExchange. Products offered for sale on CannExchange must comply with all laws and regulations and with CannExchange's policies. The sale of illegal, unsafe, or other restricted products is strictly prohibited. We encourage you to consult with your legal counsel if you have questions about the laws and regulations concerning your products. All products and listings must also comply with applicable laws. In addition, any restricted items below are for informational purposes only, and CannExchange does not warrant the accuracy of any information provided. If you supply a product in violation of the law or any of CannExchange's policies, including those listed in the Prohibited Products section, we will take corrective actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to immediately suspending or terminating selling privileges, terminating the business relationship, and permanent withholding of payments. The sale of illegal or unsafe products can also lead to legal action, including civil and criminal penalties. We are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers and working with regulators, third party experts, vendors, and sellers to improve the ways we detect and prevent illegal and unsafe products from reaching our marketplace. CannExchange encourages you to report listings that violate CannExchange's policies or applicable law by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sellercentral.amazon.com/cu/contact-us\">contacting us</a>.
